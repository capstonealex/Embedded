Quick Overview
Download the rt-test files from https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/rt-tests/
Extract them into a folder.
Run make all. Run 'make NUMA=0' if you encounter errors with the former.
sudo ./cyclictest -p 80 while in the working folder will start the cyclic test. -p 80 is for priority.
Run a cpu stress test at same time while benchmarking. Get debian package for stress from here https://packages.debian.org/stretch/armhf/stress/download. Copy to BBB and install using dpkg.
stress --cpu 64 --io 64 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M & --timeout 120
